# Final Capstone Project - Appointments App

> This is the final [Microverse's](www.microverse.org) capstone project!!
The purpose of the project is to create a Full-Stack app that works with a backend in Rails and a Frontend in React.
This repo contains the backend project.
It's a Rails API that is able to receive connections to:
- Create and authenticate users
- Get a list of available tutors
- Make an appointment with a tutor
- Show the list of the user's appointments


## Built With

- Ruby on Rails

## Live Demo

You can find the complete and functional app here:
